<textarea id="area">Hey name,

My name is Jared, I am part of the marketing team of Ademento. Upon scouting for potential clients on TikTok, we’ve identified you as someone who we could work with as a trustworthy & motivative influencer.

As you may know, TikTok recently launched their creator fund of $200 million.. Compared to YouTube, that is pocket change. We believe that influencers on TikTok deserve the monetary compensation for putting in the work and growing a large following. ITEM Beauty created by Addison Rae, Sisters Apparel by James Charles, DixieCharliRingLights by the D’Amelio sisters.. Making a full time living on social media is made possible by leveraging your audience and monetizing them through different services/products. And we want to make it possible for you too..
